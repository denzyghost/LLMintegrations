# LLMintegrations
This repository has the purpose of storing the implementation of the LLM APIs in Python, initially.
In any case, feel free to suggest any integration or improvement.

## Step by step

1. Download the folder corresponding to the LLM you are interested in, or clone the entire repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/denzyghost/LLMintegrations.git
```
2. Open the directory corresponding to any LLM or run the following command in the terminal: 
```python
python -m  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Create a .env file in the LLM root directory with the API key, like this:
```.env
MODEL_API_KEY="MODEL_API_KEY"
```
4. Run the main .py file from the model API implementation directory

## What to do Next?
If you followed the entire step-by-step guide and the API responded correctly, now simply use the API implementation structure for your purposes, commercial or personal.
